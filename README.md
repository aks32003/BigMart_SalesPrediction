**PySales Predictor**
PySales Predictor is a Python-based data analysis project designed to create a model that predicts sales. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to identify the best model for accurate sales forecasting. PySales Predictor leverages Python's data analysis and machine learning libraries to forecast sales based on historical data. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, error checking, and model selection to determine the most accurate predictive model.

**Features**
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Multiple machine learning algorithms
* Model evaluation and comparison
* Error analysis and best model selection
* Data Preparation
Data preparation involves cleaning and transforming the raw data to make it suitable for model training. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

**Modeling**
Various machine learning models are trained on the prepared data, including but not limited to:

* Linear Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Neural Networks

**Error Checking**
To evaluate the performance of each model, we use the following error metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
These metrics help in understanding the accuracy and reliability of the models.

**Best Model Selection**
After training and evaluating multiple models, the best model is selected based on the lowest error metrics and highest R-squared value. The selected model is then used for sales prediction.
